# No-xManager
Lets face it, xManager isn't doing their job. People are starting to turn to alternative solutions.

Spotify has started upping their measures against mobile Spotify modding. This isn't good for people that don't want to hear a Spotify ad every 3 minutes.
xManager is a manager app for hosting spoofed versions of Spotify that get updated every 3 months and banned every 5 days.

# This is a simple fix for this problem:
1. Install Anti-Split M and Revanced Manager
2. Split modules from the Spotify APK.
3. Patch with Revanced Manager options.
4. Reinstall the newly patched Spotify

# This is the method that xManager has been using for a LONG time.
But people just don't wanna keep doing that every week.
